# `dmptmp`

`dmptmp` creates a tempfile and writes `stdin` to it.

## Installation

```

```

## Usage

```console
$ echo Hello, World | dmptmp
/var/folders/p_/hbkf2rp10v983_x34cw14svr0000gn/T/4020381166

$ cat /var/folders/p_/hbkf2rp10v983_x34cw14svr0000gn/T/4020381166
Hello, World
```

### Help

```console
$ dmptmp -h
dmptmp

dmptmp creates a new temporary file in the directory --dir.
The filename is generated by taking --pattern and adding a random string to the end.
If pattern includes a "*", the random string replaces the last "*".
If dir is the empty string, dmptmp uses the default directory for temporary files.

Usage of dmptmp:
  -dir string
    	Directory in which to create temp file
  -pattern string
    	Pattern for constructing filename
```
